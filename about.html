      I like to code so much that I made it my job! I’ve worked with different general purpose programming languages such as python, java, some javascript/node code I’m not really proud of and Scala and languages as R, Stata and Matlab.
      I actually like the theory behind programming languages and deepened my knowledge about that in the Coursera “Programming Launguages – Part A” course.
      I'm interested in other functional languages as well and I would like to work with Ruby as well.

      I have a great interests in Mathematics which I studied at an academical level for some time. For me math is something that helps us to discover and understand reality a little bit better and Scala does a great job reflecting such concepts.

      But my life it’s not just coding! I like Pen&Paper Role Playing and board games. I’m a fan of Fantasy and Sci-Fi stories - better if in form of a movie, tv series or videogame. </h5>
